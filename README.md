## Processing-SVM

Beginnings of a Support Vector Machines library for [Processing](http://processing.org).

Support Vector Machines is a machine learning technique for classifying data based on a labeled training set. Eventually, this library will include conveniences for vectorizing text and image data, saving learned parameters for later use, etc. For now, it includes only a very thin wrapper around libsvm with some default parameters and an example of how to use it to classify text as spam/not spam. (The example is heavily based on [this blog post by Ilya Grigorik](http://www.igvita.com/2008/01/07/support-vector-machines-svm-in-ruby/)).

Very early days. Being developed as part of the curriculum for [Makematics](http://makematics.com) at [NYU ITP](http://itp.nyu.edu). More soon.
