# P-SVM: Support Vector Machines for Processing

This is a machine learning library for Processing that uses Support Vector Machines. It is based on the open source [LibSVM](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) project.

It is currently in a pre-alpha stage. Examples and API are primitive, but functional. Look for more helpers and better examples in the coming weeks.

Download [here](https://github.com/downloads/atduskgreg/Processing-SVM/PSVM.zip) to install. See the examples that come with the library for basic training and loading usage.
